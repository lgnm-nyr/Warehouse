                    <p class="tutorial">Firstly ensure the workpiece is secured safely. Adopt a stable balanced stance
                        when handing the tool that allows full control of the machine.
                        When cutting, always cut in a straight line, making sure not to trap or pinch the wheel into the
                        cut. Do not try to force the wheel through the workpiece either and also do not apply pressure
                        from the side of the wheel.
                        A grinding disc should not be used to explicitly cut off areas from a work piece. Likewise, do
                        not grind on an area of cut-off as it will not be strong enough.
                        After completing usage of the tool, wait for the wheel to finish turning and then set down the
                        tool. Never apply pressure in an act to slow the wheel down faster.

                    <p class="title">Belt Sander</p>
                    <p class="tutorial">Before handling the belt sander, ensure that clothing is kept well clear from
                        the sander. Then the sander can be turned on, allowing the motor to reach full speed.
                        Using two hands, one on the trigger and the other on the forward handle, ease the sander onto
                        the workpiece. The rear part of the roller should make contact first and then followed by the
                        rest of the sander.
                        Maintain a firm grip on the sander as the wood will grab at the sander and pull it away. For
                        optimal use, work the sander with the grain of the wood, avoiding keeping it in one place.
                        To turn off the sander, come off the trigger and wait for the belt to stop rotating. Then unplug
                        the tool and wait for it to cool down before storing it.

                    <p class="tutorial">First scan your work area to ensure there is space to operate the saw and that
                        there are no obstructions. Then check that the
                        chain has good tension to it. To test this, see if the chain can be tugged from the guide bar
                        without disengagement from the bar.
                        After this, prime the saw by turning the power on but not revving it up. Once in a steady
                        position, press the trigger to start moving the chain.
                        Always ensure that you cut off to the side or angled away from you to minimize injury if
                        kickback occurs.
                        When making a cut, keep the throttle on throughout the time of the cut. To turn the saw off, go
                        off the throttle, unplug and let the saw cool down. It can then be stored safely.

                        To remove the battery, press the unlock buttons on either side of the battery and slide out the
                        pack with care.
                        To charge the battery, plug the charger into the power source through connection. Charging will
                        take around 1 - 2 hours.
                        A flashing green indicator lamp shows charging in progress. Charging completion is shown by the
                        green lamp staying lit.
                        To install the battery back to the drill, push the battery back into the drill handle until a
                        ‘clicking’ sound will indicate it is secured.
                        The trigger switch on the drill is progressive and allows the user to start drilling slowly. The
                        torque of the drill can be pre selected by
                        turning the control sleeve at the front of the drill from 1 being lowest torque to 15 for larger
                        screws or tougher materials.

                    <p class="tutorial">To fit the blade to the saw, turn the tool upside down and loosen the screw that
                        secures the blade. Then insert the blade into the blade chunk,
                        pushing the blade firmly and finally tightening the screw. Make sure the teeth are facing
                        forwards from the tool.
                        The blade can be in a horizontal or vertical position and this can be adjusted with the switch
                        on the side. A ‘clicking’ sound indicates
                        the blade has been fixed into the desired position correctly. When the blade is secured, ensure
                        the blade guard is refitted.
                        Before switching the tool on, keep the front of the sole plate on the work. Then turn the saw on
                        by plugging it in and switching it on.
                        Stagger the speed as the tool is brought in contact with the work piece.
                        When operating the saw use a vice or a clamp to maintain steadiness when working. It is also
                        advised that
                        a stable stance is adopted that provides a good view of the off cut while maintaining distance
                        from the blade.

                    <p class="title">Mitre Saw</p>
                    <p class="tutorial">Firstly set the saw on a stable workbench and then if needed fit a dust
                        extraction unit. If one is not used, make sure the work area is ventilated.
                        To fit the saw to the workbench, pull out the 2 rear base stabilisers until they are in contact
                        with the bench and then tighten with the retaining screw.
                        For further stability screws can be inserted through the 4 holes in each corner of the saw to
                        directly secure it to the bench.
                        When cutting longer pieces of timber, prepare a side support that is the exact same height as
                        the bed of the unit.
                        When making adjustments to either the bevel angles or mitre, after sliding the rear fences, they
                        must be reset to ensure they support the workpiece and do not intrude onto the blade.
                        Once setup is complete, the saw can be started by squeezing the switch trigger. To stop release
                        the trigger.

                        Likewise, to fit brad nails, follow the same procedure but insert upto a maximum of 2 strips of
                        brad nails.
                        After inserting the desired nails, insert a fully charged battery at the base of the tool’s

                    <p class="tutorial">Firstly make sure all work is free from nails, screws or other protrusions. If
                        these cannot be removed, secure them below the surface level of the surface.
                        Make sure the machine is switched off and not connected to a power supply and then turn the
                        sander upside down.
                        Fit the sander with the desired abrasive. Typically, start with a medium grade and then would
                        through to a finer finish. The abrasive disc is held on the backing pad with a hook and loop
                        system.
                        To place the abrasive on, align the extraction holes on the back pad with the ones on the
                        abrasive, then simply push them together.
                        There is an inbuilt dust extraction system within the sander and to remove the dust bag, simply
                        slide the bag back. To refit, follow the reverse.
                        Speed controls on the control dial vary from 1 (4,500rpm) - 6 (12,000rpm).
                        When the sander is operational, but there is no connection to the surface the rotational speed
                        will be low. This is due to the inbuilt safety brake.

                    <p class="tutorial">To install the bits of a rotary drill, hold the chuck at the front of the tool
                        and then push it towards the rear. While keeping the chuck inplace, pick the bit with the free
                        hand and insert into the chuck. Wrist the bit until it sits into the seat of the chuck.
                        With the bit attachment installed, connect the rotary hammer to power with the battery and
                        ensure the correct part is being used for the job.
                        Then align the tip of the drill with the target area and secure placement. It is good practice
                        to create a pilot hole first and then switch from drilling to hammering and drilling to go
                        through the rest of the workpiece.

                    <p class="tutorial">Make sure the correct cutter is equipped for the right job for the router.
                        Firstly switch off the machine and unplug it before fitting the cutter. Grip the spindle with
                        the spanner provided and slide the spindle lock plate to stop it turning.
                        Then use the second spanner to open the collet which will allow the cutter’s shank to be placed
                        into the jaws for tightening into place.
                        To set the depth of cut, twist the max nut on the threaded pillar till it is as near to the base
                        plate as possible.
                        Then release the locking lever and lower the tool until the workpiece is in contact with the
                        cutter.
                        After placing the cutter, lock the body in place and then turn the depth adjustment knob until
                        the slide depth resets on one of the top three depth stop screws.
                        Finally raise the depth stop to the required amount for cutting with the scale, making sure the
                        nut on the threaded pillar touches the lug.
